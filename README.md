# api-security-genai

Project Description

This repository contains my second hands-on learning project. In this project, I explore API discovery and security analysis by leveraging generative AI (ChatGPT) alongside a suite of command-line tools in Termux. The project demonstrates how to capture API traffic, analyze it using OpenAIâ€™s LLM, and identify potential security issues such as insecure direct object references (IDOR), authentication weaknesses, and more.

This is an experimental project aimed at enhancing my skills in both cybersecurity and modern AI integration. As I continue to learn, I plan to expand this project with features like bulk analysis of API calls, automatic generation of OpenAPI specifications, and a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.
